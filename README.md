# ChoreTracker
#
# A mobile Java app group project which handles Chores between Parent and Child accounts, allowing parents to assign chores and children to collect points for completing them
#
# For setup, you will need an IDE like Android Studio that allows for Android OS simulation.
# Download Android Studio here:
#https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
#
# You will need to clone the internal ChoreTracker repository.
#
# Additionally, 2 other artifacts from this project are attached.
#
# The UI Project as an assignment to create hypothetical users for our project, develop a draft User Interface considering those users, and getting feedback from peers and non-computer-science people.
# In this project, I realized that different people will have different motivations for using the software. A chore-tracker might be resented by a child-user who could look to abuse exploits. This helped us organize our backend use-cases almost more than develop a UI.
# If I were to do this over, I would try to get feedback from people who fit the demographic of our potential users.
#
# The Project Plan Document was a comprehensive plan for how our project was to be organized. It includes use-cases and testing plans and procedure.
# In this writup, our team organized our ideas and developed a more specific, cohesive idea of what the end result would look like and how the software would be organized. I learned that no matter how specific a team is when talking about a project, it's difficult to get everyone on the same page until you put it down in writing where it can be referenced to solve disagreements.
# If we were to do this over, we could add a more specific workflow timeline that includes who will be assigned to each task.
